# particle-based-causal-ai-dashboard
Particle-Based Causal AI Decision Dashboard is a real-time multimodal AI system built using PyTorch, Streamlit, NumPy, and Pandas. It implements a unified multimodal neural network with separate electrical, physical, and dynamic pathways. Monte Carlo dropout sampling is used to model prediction uncertainty and probabilistic state distributions. The Streamlit dashboard streams sequential data from a dataset, performs live inference, and visualizes predictions, confidence, and uncertainty. This system demonstrates coherence-driven decision intelligence, uncertainty-aware inference, and robust multimodal AI monitoring in a production-style interactive interface.
